# Vir-Tant 

Vir-Tant is your virtual voice assistant, which listens to your commands and act accordingly.

This project listens to the user's command and translates the voice command to text. And after processing the text and working on the task, it converts the result back to the voice command and returns as the output.

My Vir-Tant has loads of features from opening an app on your computer to sending an email.

Let us discuss it's features to know the assistant well.

## 1-Wish the user
Every time the program is initialized, it greets the user and wishes him/her 
according to the current time of the system.

## 2-Waking the Assistant
Every time a user says the word 'hello' the assistant initializes and begins to listen, This feature is implemented to avoid accidental speech.

## 3-Launching an app
Just ask the Vir-Tant to open an app like "open photos" or                              "play music", and it will do as the command says. 

## 4-Fetch the Information from Wikipedia  
Need some quick information about something? what could be better than Wikipedia? Vir-Tant makes it even easier, just say " Wikipedia "  along with your query, the Vir-Tant is ready with your answer. 

## 5-Open a Web-Site
You can also open a website just by saying the name of the site. 
Example-just say  "open youtube" and the assistant will open youtube's website.

## 6-Make a Note
Got an urgent message which you wanna save instantly??
your assistant will back you up! Ask to "make a note" or "write this down" and then you will receive feedback from the program after that speak the urgent message to the assistant, it will make your note

### Note

The following two features are the flagship features of the Vir-Tant. It involved complex coding. but don't worry, the modulated and refactored code will help the reader, understand each line of the code impeccably.

## 7-Sending an Email
Now with this assistant, the user can even send emails to their peers.
It uses the protocol named SMTP to open a socket and for sending the email.
The user needs to provide his/her "EmailId" and "Password" in the code itself along with the recipient's email to enable this feature. and ask for "email to" and the recipient name to enable this feature. After the assistant's feedback, say your message and boom! the email is delivered.

## 8-Accessing the Calender
The calendar meant here is the Google Calendar. The Vir-Tant access google's API to open your personised calendar and returns your events.
just ask the assistant "what do I have" on Monday, It will return all your events on the next Monday. 
But, it's not done yet! you can even frame your own way of saying the exact same date. It could be like "Tuesday" or "June 22" or "22nd June". It will still figure out what the user wants to say and returns the events you possess on the very day.

### Please take time to read the code, I will be more than happy if you run this code on your local machine.

### Any further feedback will be appreciated.
